# Introduction 

Welcome to Paket. Paket is a utility platform for streaming media services that unifies authentication, billing, and discovery into a seamless and frictionless experience for users.

While nearly all of the Platform's business logic (including account creation, billing, recurring payments, etc.) happens on Paket's end, streaming service providers will need to integrate with Paket's API to be able to authenticate users and to access the authenticated user's entitlements to the respective service via the Paket API.

# Getting Started

Before we begin, it's important to understand the key concepts and taxonomy of the platform, each of which can be configured in the [Paket Publisher Portal](https://publisher.paket.tv):

**Companies**: The `Company` is the primary object to which Apps are associated. This is where the business details are configured. In most situations, an account will have only one Company;

**Apps**: The `App` is the primary object to which Clients and Licenses are associated. This is the high-level representation of your service, its consumer-facing title (e.g., Hulu), description, and supporting metadata;

**Licenses**: The `License` object represents an entitlement offered via your App (e.g., Limited Ads at $5.99 / mo, No Ads at $9.99 / mo, etc.); and

**Clients**: The `Client` object contains the platform or device-specific Paket auth (OAuth2) configuration for a service's user-facing Application client (e.g., Roku, iOS, Android, etc.).

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
